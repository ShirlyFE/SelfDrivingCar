# CarND-Controls-PID

## PID Control

PID controllers are simple reactive controllers that are widely used. The difference between the measured and the desired value (setpoint) of a process variable of a system is fed into the PID controller as an error signal. Depending on the PID parameters a control output is generated to steer the system closer to the setpoint. In the present project, a car simulator produces the error signal as the distance between the actual car position on the road and a reference trajectory, known as cross-track error (cte). The PID controller is designed to minimize the distance to this reference trajectory. The primary control output of the PID controller here is the steering angle.

### P - proportional gain

The proportional term computes an output proportional to the cross-track error. A pure P - controller is unstable and at best oscillates about the setpoint. The proportional gain contributes a control output to the steering angle of the form -K_p cte with a positive constant K_p.

### D - differential gain

The oscillations caused by purely D control can be mitigated by a term proportional to the derivative of the cross-track error. The derivative gain contributes a control output of the form -K_d d/dt cte, with a positive constant K_d.

### I - integral gain

A third contribution is given by the integral gain which simply sums up the cross-track error over time. The corresponding contribution to the steering angle is given by -K_i sum(cte). Thereby, biases can be mitigated, for instance if a zero steering angle does not correspond to a straight trajectory. At high speeds this term can also be useful to accumulate a large error signal quickly, for instance when the car is carried out sideways from the reference trajectory. This allows to reduce proportional gain, which causes oscillations at high speeds. 

### Hyperparameter tuning

All parameters were tuned manually by varying each of the gains in a similar fashion to the "twiddle" algorithm. This allowed me to to intuitively understand the contribution of each gain factor.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/12dd29d8-2755-4b1b-8e03-e8f16796bea8)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
